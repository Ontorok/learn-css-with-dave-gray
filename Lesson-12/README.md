1. <code>column-count</code> rule divide a section into columns according with value.
2. <code>column-width</code> rule set a min-width of a column. For example, let column-count is 4 and column-width is 250px. If screen size is 1000px, then column-count is set to 4, if screen size is less than 1000px then column count set to 3 and so on. [N.B.: In this example, we avoid column gap].
3. <code>columns</code> rule is a short hand for column-count and column-width
4. <code>column-gap</code> rule set spacing between columns.
5. <h2>Always be concerned about css specification</h2>
