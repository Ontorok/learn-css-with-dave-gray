1.  Class has more speficity than an element.
    p {}
    .class {}
    Here the class rule will apply because of class has declared after element as we know css means cascading style sheet that read a css file like as water fall as top to bottom.

    .class {}
    p{}
    Here also the class rule will apply because of class has more specifity than an element

2.  All css rule does not inherite from their parent.
3.  \* {} is called universal selector. It used for selected all elements. It is not used for inheritance.
4.  Do not use id selector (#) in css file. It is a bad practice.
