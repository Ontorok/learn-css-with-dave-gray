1. <code>space-between</code> : put equal space every two items. Since there is no item before first item so no space add befor first item and after last item.

2. <code>space-around</code> : put equal space on every item. If there is three elements, spaces are distributed like this, before first item is 2px, after first item is 4px (2px for first item and 2px for 2nd item)

3. <code>space-evenly</code> : put equal space on every item. If there is three elements, spaces are distributed like this, before first item is 2px, after first item is 4px (2px for first item and 2px for 2nd item)

4. <code>flex-grow/flex-shrink</code> : its a numeric value to grow or shrink with percentage. For example, let's have a container of 2 items and container size 250px. Each one has flex basis 100px. Then each item will take 100px and remaining 50px will take equally by two items. But if any one has flex-grow of 2 then that item will take double space than other item take.
